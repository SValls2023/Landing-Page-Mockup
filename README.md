## About
Landing-Page-Mockup is a HTML/CSS foundations project created with the goal of preparing myself to become more conforatbale building websites with HTML, with beginning to practice CSS fundamentals along the way. In this particular project, the CSS concepts used were: the box model (border, padding, margin), block vs inline elements, and element alignment through flexbox.

### Important Concepts
- HTML Structure/Boilerplate
- Elements and tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc.)
- CSS Basics (Selectors/Selector Chaining, Color, Typography, Growing/Shrinking, Images)
- Box Model (border, padding, margin)
- Inline vs Blocks Elements (`<div>` [block] vs `<span>` [inline])
- Flexbox (flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, align-content)

I am also proud to implement anchor elements to help with webpage navigation. Through this, I was able to learn how to structure certain webpages while still making an effort to provide a user friendly experience.

### Future Improvements
While making a brand new recipe page is not on my future scope, this project makes me consider the idea of posting them in a future blog as a way to overall have fun and add more personality to myself/my page.
