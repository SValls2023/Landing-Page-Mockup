## About
Landing-Page-Mockup is a HTML/CSS foundations project created with the goal of preparing myself to become more conforatbale building websites with HTML, with beginning to practice CSS fundamentals along the way. In this particular project, the CSS concepts used were: the box model (border, padding, margin), block vs inline elements, and element alignment through flexbox.

### Important Concepts
- HTML Structure/Boilerplate
- Elements and tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc.)
- CSS Basics (Selectors/Selector Chaining, Color, Typography, Growing/Shrinking, Images)
- Box Model (border, padding, margin)
- Inline vs Blocks Elements (`<div>` [block] vs `<span>` [inline])
- Flexbox (flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, align-content)

### Accomplishments
I am proud to begin moving around elements within the webpage's space using flex-box (align-items, justify-content, width, padding, margin). It was a challenge learning how to layout parts of a standard webpage like the navbar, the hero, the quote section, etc. This project is my first step into eventually building an organized webpage using the tools provided to me by CSS.

### Future Improvements
My main goal in regards to future CSS required projects is to eventually practice using more tools that encourage more dynamic sizing, rather than relying on static pixel sizes. Responsive design will be a must if I ever want to share my projects with full confidence in the future.
