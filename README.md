## About
Landing-Page-Mockup is a HTML/CSS foundations project created with the goal of preparing myself to become more conforatbale building websites with HTML, with beginning to practice CSS fundamentals along the way. In this particular project, the CSS concepts used were: the box model (border, padding, margin), block vs inline elements, and element alignment through flexbox.

### Important Concepts
- HTML Structure/Boilerplate
- Elements and tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc.)
- CSS Basics (Selectors/Selector Chaining, Color, Typography, Growing/Shrinking, Images)
- Box Model (border, padding, margin)
- Inline vs Blocks Elements (`<div>` [block] vs `<span>` [inline])
- Flexbox (flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, align-content)
